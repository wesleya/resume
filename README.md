# Resume

This is a simple resume I made for myself, a backend web developer with some minimal front end experience.

Using this repo as my resume, plus as a testing ground for newest/beta versions of Laravel, VueJS, Bootstrap, etc.

## Installation

This is built on the Laravel PHP framework

1. clone repo
2. run composer update
3. run gulp

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
